# KYC Progress Auto-Population Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds the ability to automatically populate and verify phone numbers in the KYC screen when users return with existing registration progress.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Auto-Population from API**
- When KYC screen loads, it checks for existing registration progress
- If `currentStep: 2` and `isPhoneVerified: true`, phone field is auto-populated
- Phone number is formatted as "+91{phoneNumber}" and shown in the field
- Email is also auto-populated if available

### 2. **Phone Field State Management**
- **Disabled when verified**: Phone field becomes read-only when pre-populated
- **Visual indicator**: Shows "Phone number loaded from previous registration" message
- **Verification badge**: Shows green checkmark for verified phone immediately

### 3. **Smart Loading States**
- **Loading indicator**: Shows "Loading your registration progress..." while fetching data
- **Seamless transition**: Smoothly transitions from loading to populated form
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles API failures and continues with normal flow

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **No re-verification needed**: Users don't need to verify phone again
- **Progress continuity**: Maintains refId and other progress data
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indicators for what's pre-filled vs. what needs completion

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `kyc_form_viewmodel.dart`
- Added `RegistrationProgressService` integration
- Added `loadExistingProgress()` method
- Added `_isLoadingProgress` state management
- Auto-populates phone, email, verification status, and refId

#### 2. `kyc.dart`
- Added `loadExistingProgress()` call in `initState`
- Added loading indicator for progress fetching
- Disabled phone field when verified
- Added visual indicator for pre-filled data
- Enhanced conditional rendering based on verification state

### Key Methods:

#### `loadExistingProgress()`
```dart
// Checks API for existing progress
// If currentStep == 2 && isPhoneVerified == true:
//   - Populates phone field with "+91{phone}"
//   - Sets _isPhoneVerified = true
//   - Auto-fills email if available
//   - Preserves refId for future API calls
```

#### Enhanced Phone Field
```dart
PhoneNumberField(
  enabled: !viewModel.isPhoneVerified, // Disabled when verified
  // ... other props
)
```

## User Flow

1. **User opens KYC screen** → Loading indicator appears
2. **API call made** → Checks registration progress
3. **If progress found with verified phone**:
   - Phone field auto-populated and disabled
   - Green verification badge shown
   - "Phone number loaded from previous registration" message
   - Password fields enabled and focused
4. **User enters passwords** → "Complete KYC & Continue" button enabled
5. **User clicks continue** → Proceeds to next step

## API Integration

- **Endpoint**: Uses existing `RegistrationProgressService`
- **Data Used**: `currentStep`, `isPhoneVerified`, `phone`, `email`, `refId`
- **Condition**: Only auto-populates if `currentStep == 2` and `isPhoneVerified == true`

## Error Handling

- API failures are logged but don't block the user
- If progress loading fails, form works in normal mode
- User can still manually enter phone and verify if auto-population fails

## Visual States

1. **Loading**: Spinner with "Loading your registration progress..."
2. **Pre-populated**: Disabled phone field with blue info indicator
3. **Verified**: Green checkmark badge and success message
4. **Ready**: "Complete KYC & Continue" button when passwords filled

This implementation ensures users can seamlessly continue their registration from where they left off, with clear visual feedback about what's already completed.
