# Building Anudha Mart: A Deep Dive into Flutter Architecture

Building a robust e-commerce application requires careful architectural planning and implementation. In this post, we'll explore how Anudha Mart was built using modern Flutter architecture patterns.

## The Challenge

When we started building Anudha Mart, we faced several key challenges:

- **Scalability**: The app needed to handle complex business logic for vendors, KYC verification, and bid management
- **Maintainability**: Multiple developers working on different features required clean code organization
- **Performance**: Real-time features and data synchronization demanded efficient state management
- **Security**: Handling sensitive business and personal data required robust security measures

## Our Solution: MVVM + BLoC Architecture

We chose to implement a combination of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with BLoC (Business Logic Component) for state management. This hybrid approach gives us the best of both worlds.

### Architecture Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Presentation Layer                       │
│                   (Views & Widgets)                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    Business Logic Layer                     │
│                     (BLoC & Cubits)                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                      Data Layer                            │
│                (Models & Repositories)                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    Service Layer                           │
│              (APIs, Storage, External)                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a clear responsibility
2. **Testability**: Business logic is isolated and easily testable
3. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different features  
4. **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others

## Implementation Highlights

### BLoC Pattern for State Management

```dart
class AuthBloc extends Bloc<AuthEvent, AuthState> {
  AuthBloc({required this.authRepository}) : super(AuthInitial()) {
    on<AuthLoginRequested>(_onLoginRequested);
    on<AuthLogoutRequested>(_onLogoutRequested);
  }

  Future<void> _onLoginRequested(
    AuthLoginRequested event,
    Emitter<AuthState> emit,
  ) async {
    emit(AuthLoading());
    try {
      final user = await authRepository.login(
        email: event.email,
        password: event.password,
      );
      emit(AuthSuccess(user: user));
    } catch (error) {
      emit(AuthFailure(error: error.toString()));
    }
  }
}
```

### Repository Pattern for Data Access

```dart
abstract class AuthRepository {
  Future<User> login({required String email, required String password});
  Future<void> logout();
  Future<User?> getCurrentUser();
}

class AuthRepositoryImpl implements AuthRepository {
  const AuthRepositoryImpl({
    required this.authService,
    required this.storageService,
  });

  @override
  Future<User> login({required String email, required String password}) async {
    final userDto = await authService.login(email: email, password: password);
    final user = User.fromDto(userDto);
    await storageService.saveUser(user);
    return user;
  }
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Feature-based folder structure** made it easy for teams to work independently
- **BLoC pattern** provided predictable state management across the app
- **Repository pattern** made it easy to switch between different data sources
- **Dependency injection** improved testability and modularity

### What We'd Do Differently

- Start with **code generation** for models and API clients from the beginning
- Implement **automated testing** earlier in the development cycle
- Use **feature flags** for gradual rollout of new features
- Set up **CI/CD pipeline** from day one

## Future Improvements

We're continuously improving the architecture:

- **Migrating to riverpod** for even better dependency injection
- **Adding offline-first capabilities** with local database synchronization
- **Implementing micro-frontends** approach for better team scalability
- **Enhanced error handling** with user-friendly error messages

## Conclusion

Building Anudha Mart has been an incredible journey of learning and implementation. The MVVM + BLoC architecture has served us well, providing the foundation for a scalable, maintainable, and performant Flutter application.

The key takeaway is that architecture isn't just about following patterns—it's about choosing the right tools and patterns that solve your specific problems and enable your team to build great products.
