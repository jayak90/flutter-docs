# Architecture Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Separation of Concerns
**Problem**: The `hot_deals_screen.dart` was incorrectly using `HomeBloc` for deals-specific functionality, violating the single responsibility principle.

**Solution**: Created a dedicated `DealsBloc` for managing deals-related state and moved all bid view logic from `HomeBloc` to `DealsBloc`.

### 2. Missing Deals Feature Architecture
**Problem**: The deals feature was missing proper MVVM + BLoC architecture components.

**Solution**: Created the complete deals feature structure following the project's architecture pattern:

```
features/deals/
├── data/
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── deal.dart              # Deal data model
│   └── services/
│       └── deals_service.dart     # API service for deals
└── presentation/
    ├── bloc/
    │   └── deals_bloc.dart        # State management for deals
    ├── viewmodels/
    │   └── deals_viewmodel.dart   # Business logic layer
    ├── screens/
    │   └── hot_deals_screen.dart  # UI screen (updated)
    └── widgets/
        ├── today_bids.dart        # Existing widgets
        ├── past_bids.dart
        ├── past_bid_tile.dart
        └── info_card.dart
```

### 3. State Management Cleanup
**Problem**: `HomeBloc` contained deals-specific state (`BidView`, `selectedBidView`) that didn't belong there.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `BidView` logic from `HomeBloc`
- Moved `BidViewChanged` event to `DealsBloc`
- Cleaned up `MenuItemsLoaded` state in `HomeBloc`

### 4. Proper Dependency Injection
**Problem**: Missing service registration for deals feature.

**Solution**: Updated `service_locator.dart` to register `DealsService` and `DealsViewModel`.

### 5. BLoC Provider Registration
**Problem**: `DealsBloc` wasn't available app-wide.

**Solution**: Added `DealsBloc` to `MultiBlocProvider` in `app.dart`.

### 6. Home Screen Integration
**Problem**: `home_screen.dart` wasn't properly integrated with the existing architecture.

**Solution**: Added proper initialization of `HomeBloc` in `home_screen.dart`'s `initState()`.

## Architecture Compliance

The project now follows the MVVM + BLoC architecture pattern as specified in the README.md:

### ✅ Model Layer
- **Deal model**: Represents deal data with proper serialization
- **Services**: `DealsService` handles API calls and data fetching

### ✅ View Layer  
- **Screens**: UI components in `presentation/screens/`
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components in `presentation/widgets/`

### ✅ ViewModel Layer
- **DealsViewModel**: Handles business logic and data preparation
- **HomeViewModel**: Existing home business logic

### ✅ BLoC Layer
- **DealsBloc**: Manages deals-specific state and events
- **HomeBloc**: Manages home-specific state (cleaned up)
- **AuthBloc**: Existing authentication state management

## File Changes Made

1. **Created New Files**:
   - `lib/features/deals/data/models/deal.dart`
   - `lib/features/deals/data/services/deals_service.dart`
   - `lib/features/deals/presentation/viewmodels/deals_viewmodel.dart`
   - `lib/features/deals/presentation/bloc/deals_bloc.dart`

2. **Updated Existing Files**:
   - `lib/core/di/service_locator.dart` - Added deals dependencies
   - `lib/app.dart` - Added DealsBloc provider
   - `lib/features/home/presentation/bloc/home_bloc.dart` - Removed deals logic
   - `lib/features/home/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart` - Added proper initialization
   - `lib/features/deals/presentation/screens/hot_deals_screen.dart` - Updated to use DealsBloc

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each feature has its own dedicated state management
2. **Maintainable Code**: Easy to add new deals functionality without affecting home feature
3. **Testable Architecture**: Each BLoC can be tested independently
4. **Scalable Design**: New features can follow the same pattern
5. **MVVM Compliance**: Follows the established architecture pattern consistently

## Usage

### For Deals Feature:
```dart
// Loading deals
context.read<DealsBloc>().add(LoadTodayDeals());

// Changing bid view
context.read<DealsBloc>().add(BidViewChanged(BidView.past));

// Listening to state
BlocBuilder<DealsBloc, DealsState>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is DealsLoaded) {
      // Use state.todayDeals, state.pastDeals, state.selectedBidView
    }
  },
)
```

### For Home Feature:
```dart
// Loading menu items
context.read<HomeBloc>().add(LoadMenuItems());

// Selecting menu item
context.read<HomeBloc>().add(MenuItemSelected('Dashboard'));
```

The architecture is now properly separated, maintainable, and follows the project's established patterns.
