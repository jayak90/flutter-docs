# Incomplete Registration Handling Implementation

## Overview

This implementation handles the scenario where a user has uninstalled the application and starts the signup process again with their email. The system will now check if there are any incomplete registration steps on the server and prompt the user to continue from where they left off.

## Features

### 1. Server-Side Progress Check
- When a user enters their email and clicks "Continue" on the registration screen
- The system first validates the email format and checks if it already exists
- **NEW**: If the email doesn't exist in the "already registered" sense, the system checks for incomplete registration progress on the server using the email
- Uses the existing `RegistrationProgressService.checkRegistrationProgress(email)` API

### 2. User Experience Flow

#### Case 1: No Previous Registration
- Email is validated and no server-side progress is found
- User proceeds to KYC screen normally
- Email is saved to SharedPreferences for progress tracking

#### Case 2: Completed Registration
- Email exists and registration is marked as completed on server
- User sees message: "Account already exists and registration is completed. Please login instead."
- User is prompted to login

#### Case 3: Incomplete Registration ⭐ **NEW**
- Email has incomplete registration steps on the server
- User sees dialog: "You have previously started registration with this email and have incomplete steps. Would you like to continue where you left off or start over?"
- Two options provided:
  - **Continue**: Navigate directly to the incomplete step
  - **Start Over**: Begin fresh registration from KYC step

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files

#### 1. `RegisterFormViewModel.dart`
- **Added imports**: 
  - `RegistrationProgressService`
  - `RegistrationNavigationHelper`
- **Enhanced `verifyEmailAndProceed()` method**:
  - Added server-side progress check after email validation
  - Returns different response types based on progress status
  - Handles completed vs incomplete registrations
- **Added helper methods**:
  - `showContinueRegistrationDialog()` - Static method to show continue dialog
  - `navigateToCurrentStep()` - Static method to navigate to appropriate step

#### 2. `RegisterScreen.dart`
- **Enhanced `_handleContinue()` method**:
  - Added handling for `hasIncompleteRegistration` response case
- **Added `_showIncompleteRegistrationDialog()` method**:
  - Shows dialog asking user to continue or start over
  - Handles user choice and navigation
  - Properly saves email to SharedPreferences for progress tracking

### Response Structure

The `verifyEmailAndProceed()` method now returns different response types:

```dart
// Success - proceed to KYC
{'success': true, 'email': email}

// Email already exists and registration completed
{'success': false, 'emailExists': true, 'message': '...'}

// Incomplete registration found ⭐ NEW
{
  'success': false, 
  'hasIncompleteRegistration': true, 
  'progressData': progressData,
  'email': email
}

// Validation or API errors
{'success': false, 'error': errorMessage}
```

## User Interface

### Dialog for Incomplete Registration
```
Title: "Continue Registration"
Message: "You have previously started registration with this email and have incomplete steps.

Would you like to continue where you left off or start over?"

Actions:
- [Start Over] - Begins new registration from KYC
- [Continue] - Navigates to the incomplete step
```

## Technical Benefits

1. **Seamless User Experience**: Users don't lose their progress after app reinstallation
2. **Server-Side Data Integrity**: Leverages existing server-side progress tracking
3. **Flexible User Choice**: Users can choose to continue or start fresh
4. **Consistent Navigation**: Uses existing `RegistrationNavigationHelper` for step navigation
5. **Proper Data Persistence**: Ensures email is saved to SharedPreferences for progress tracking

## Error Handling

- Network errors during progress check are handled gracefully
- Falls back to normal registration flow if progress check fails
- User-friendly error messages for different scenarios
- Proper loading states during API calls

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: New User
1. Enter new email → Click Continue
2. Expected: Navigate to KYC screen

### Test Case 2: Existing Complete Registration
1. Enter email of completed registration → Click Continue
2. Expected: Show "Account exists, please login" message

### Test Case 3: Incomplete Registration - Continue
1. Enter email with incomplete registration → Click Continue
2. See continue dialog → Click "Continue"
3. Expected: Navigate to the incomplete step (e.g., Company Registration)

### Test Case 4: Incomplete Registration - Start Over
1. Enter email with incomplete registration → Click Continue
2. See continue dialog → Click "Start Over"
3. Expected: Navigate to KYC screen

## API Dependencies

- `RegistrationProgressService.checkRegistrationProgress(email)` - Must accept email as identifier
- `RegistrationNavigationHelper.showContinueRegistrationDialog()` - Existing dialog utility
- `RegistrationNavigationHelper.navigateToCurrentStep()` - Existing navigation utility

## Future Enhancements

1. **Progress Indicator**: Show registration progress percentage in the dialog
2. **Step Preview**: Display which specific steps are remaining
3. **Data Preview**: Show some of the data user had previously entered
4. **Timeout Handling**: Add automatic fallback if progress check takes too long
